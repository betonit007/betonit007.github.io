             <p style="padding-top:20px">Hello everyone, thanks for stopping by and looking at my portfolio. My full name 
                is Timothy Micheal James Nagorski, but you can just call me Tim...or as my friends sometime call me: "Timmyah!" 
                I currently live in Morrisville, NC. I lived in the Raleigh area for just over 20 years! I'm originally from
                Kirkwood, NY, a small town located in upstate New York about a hour east of Syracuse. I'm married to my beautiful wife,
                Susan and we are about to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. We have two small boys that are ages 5 and 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently self-employed, I own and operate a small drone business named TSL Aerial. We specialize in aerial photography, 
                3d mapping, and insurance claim inspections. I operate out of the RDU area and service most of North Carolina. I have over 20
                years of experience with UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) vehicles and drones. I also design, build and repair many types
                of aerial platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include: 3d modeling and printing, running and weight-training, and I'm an avid "car guy". I especially enjoy spending
                time with my family, wether it be vactioning up at Lake Gaston, watching my son's soccer games or just taking
                my sons to the pool.
